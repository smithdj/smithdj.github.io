### ABSTRACT

**Background:** Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection causes significant morbidity and mortality among people who inject drugs (PWID) and HIV+ men who have sex with men (MSM). Characterizing spontaneous viral clearance of HCV infection among PWID and HIV+ MSM is important for assessing the burden of disease and treatment strategies in these populations.

**Methods:** Electronic and other searches of medical literature were conducted. Reports were eligible if they presented original data from upper-middle- and high-income countries on laboratory-confirmed HCV infection and spontaneous viral clearance among PWID or HIV+ MSM. Pooled estimates of spontaneous viral clearance were generated using fixed-effect and random-effects models. Meta-regression examined potential predictors related to individual characteristics and research methodology.

**Results:** The meta-analysis estimated that spontaneous viral clearance occurs in 24.4 % of PWID and 15.4 % of HIV+ MSM. In univariate meta-regression among PWID, male sex and age were significantly associated with spontaneous viral clearance, and in multivariate analysis, male sex and HIV positivity were predictors of spontaneous viral clearance; among HIV+ MSM no variables were found to affect spontaneous viral clearance.

**Conclusion:** The variability in estimates of spontaneous viral clearance between HIV+ MSM and PWID suggests the impact of HIV co-infection and HCV re-infection. Due to limited data on additional factors that may affect the natural history of HCV, more research is needed to further understand spontaneous viral clearance in these risk groups.

### METHODS  

**Data Analysis**  

Report-level prevalence of spontaneous viral clearance was estimated using the binomial distribution. Pooled estimates of spontaneous viral clearance were generated using both fixed-effect and random-effects models. The Cochran’s *Q* and *I*<sup>2</sup> (Higgins, Thompson, Deeks, & Altman, 2003) measures provided assessments of heterogeneity, and random-effects meta-regression was performed to examine variability among the report-level estimates of spontaneous viral clearance [27].

We examined the possibility of assessing the role of previous infection with HIV on spontaneous viral clearance among PWID; however, because most studies did not specify which of HIV or HCV was acquired first, we were not able to directly examine this. Those PWID who were HIV positive and had unequivocal evidence of spontaneous viral clearance most likely represented an individual in whom the sequence of events was HCV infection, followed by spontaneous viral clearance, and subsequently HIV infection. All statistical analysis was conducted using Stata 13.1 [28].

### RESULTS

**Meta-analysis**
_**PWID.**_ A total of 7,488 reports were retrieved from the literature searches, and 28 were included in the final review (see Figure 1). The reports are described in Table 1a. The majority of reports described studies located in Europe (12; 43%); the remaining samples were from the United States (7; 25%), Australia (5; 18%), China (2; 7%), Canada (1; 4%), and Iran (1; 4%). Data on participant attributes were presented in greater than 50% of all reports. Sixteen reports (57%) presented age at enrollment, eighteen (64%) provided the sex distribution, and sixteen (57%) stated the proportion of HIV-positive individuals.

All 28 reports were included in the meta-analysis. Among 5,569 PWID, whose mean age at enrollment was 29.6 years (median 27.4; 15 reports), spontaneous viral clearance was observed in 1,236 participants. The random-effects meta-analysis estimate of the prevalence of spontaneous viral clearance was 24.3% (95% CI 19.5, 29.1; *Q* = 638.51, *p* < 0.001; *I*<sup>2</sup> = 95.8%). The estimate from each study is presented in the forest plot in Figure 3.

Pooled subgroup estimates also were generated to account for HIV status and quality rating. Within the sets of reports for which there were data on the HIV status of PWID, spontaneous viral clearance occurred in 25.7% (95% CI 16.4, 35.0; 13 reports) of HIV-negative participants and in 16.1% (95% CI 12.5, 19.6; 3 reports) of HIV-positive participants. In stratifying the reports by quality rating, as depicted in Table 2, the prevalence of spontaneous viral clearance was 27.6%, 24.1%, and 15.4% among high-, moderate-, and low-quality reports, respectively.

_**HIV+ MSM.**_ Following from Figure 2, the literature searches yielded 2,417 reports, of which 10 were included in the present analysis; these reports are detailed in Table 1b. Seven of the reports (70%) were on studies with cohorts drawn only from Europe. One report (10%) examined a sample from the United States, and another report (10%) assessed samples from North America, Australia, and Europe. The study location was not described in one report. Few participant characteristics were summarized consistently across the reports. Age at enrollment was presented in five reports (50%), proportion on HAART in three reports (30%), and duration of HIV infection in one report (10%).

Only 9 of the 10 reports were included in the meta-analysis. One report provided a count of zero spontaneous clearance events in the sample. We chose the conservative approach to handling the zero-count issue, which was to exclude the report from the pooled analysis. 

In aggregate, there were 588 HIV+ MSM with a mean age of 40.0 years (median 40.7; 4 reports); 96 participants experienced spontaneous viral clearance. The random-effects meta-analysis estimate of the prevalence of spontaneous viral clearance was 15.4% (95% CI 11.5, 19.3; *Q* = 13.29, *p* = 0.102; *I*<sup>2</sup> = 39.8%). The forest plot in Figure 4 provides the estimates from the contributing reports. Subgroup estimates based on quality rating also were obtained. As shown in Table 2, among high-, moderate-, and low-quality reports, prevalence of spontaneous viral clearance was 19.2%, 15.8%, and 11.3%, respectively.

**Meta-regression**
To examine the effect of report and participant characteristics on the prevalence of spontaneous viral clearance, we conducted random-effects meta-regression. Because covariates hypothesized to contribute to spontaneous viral clearance were not consistently collected or described across reports, our meta-regression was limited to a small set of factors. Both univariate and multivariate meta-regression were performed.

_**PWID.**_ Only two variables were significant in univariate analysis: male sex and age (*p* < 0.05). Spontaneous viral clearance was lower in both males and older individuals. We examined the relationship among pairs of variables (specifically, male sex, HIV-positivity, and age) through contingency tables. Fisher’s exact tests revealed no significant associations between factor dyads (results not shown; see Additional file 2). Of particular interest to our study was the impact of HIV. In our preferred multivariate model, presented in Table 3, male sex (*p* = 0.021) and HIV positivity (*p* = 0.036) were significant predictors.

_**HIV+ MSM.**_ Neither univariate nor multivariate analysis provided any evidence of an effect on spontaneous viral clearance of any of the variables (i.e., age, proportion on highly active antiretroviral therapy, recruitment site, and quality rating) evaluated.

### DISCUSSION
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we estimated that the prevalence of spontaneous viral clearance is 24.4 % in PWID and 15.4 % in HIV+ MSM. Although the estimates for PWID and HIV+ MSM were not directly compared here, the difference may be related to the impact of HIV co-infection on the natural history of HCV. The rates of spontaneous viral clearance were similar in HIV+ MSM (15.4 %) and PWID with HIV infection at the time that HCV clearance was evaluated (16.1 %). Our estimate of 24.4 % among PWID was very closely similar to the estimate from a pooled analysis of clearance among 632 participants in multiple studies (25 %) who were observed following acute infection [29]. 

Among HIV-positive PWID, lower clearance cannot reliably be attributed to the effect of HIV infection on viral kinetics because the temporal relation between HIV and HCV infections in these individuals is unclear. Moreover, estimates of spontaneous viral clearance from most studies do not necessarily represent true rates but rather the prevalence of cleared infection. Evidence of clearance at any given time in an individual is the cumulative result of behaviors that led to infection events, including multiple re-infections, and the host and viral characteristics that govern response to acute HCV infection. Although re-infection post-SVR is higher among HIV+ MSM than among PWID, it cannot be concluded that the rates of HCV re-infection in treated and untreated HIV+ MSM are higher than among treated and untreated PWID because studies of re-infection in treated PWID have in many cases excluded active injectors [14, 30]. There is no research comparing the frequency of HCV transmission behavior between these groups, and thus, there is insufficient evidence to attribute differences in clearance to differences in behavioral risk.

Our finding that female gender was associated with higher proportions of spontaneous viral clearance events is consistent with published literature demonstrating that females are more likely to clear HCV than their male counterparts in a variety of settings and other patient groups [31, 32]. 

Evaluation of the report-level spontaneous viral clearance data for each of the populations indicates that the meta-analysis estimates were affected by notable degrees of heterogeneity. Among PWID, both male sex and age were associated with lower proportions of spontaneous viral clearance events. In examining spontaneous viral clearance estimates in HIV+ MSM, the results did not suggest the effect of any of the factors considered. Given the null findings in univariate meta-regression on quality rating (*p* = 0.163) and study design (*p* = 0.182), and noting the low volume of reports for which we extracted data on participant characteristics, heterogeneity was most likely due to unmeasured clinical, patient-level characteristics (e.g., ethnicity, genotype, other viral infections) rather than methodological characteristics. However, our analysis of sources of heterogeneity was limited by the dearth of information about time to event, viral factors, and other participant attributes. . . .
