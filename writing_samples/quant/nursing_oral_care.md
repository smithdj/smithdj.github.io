### ABSTRACT

**Background:** Nursing interventions in oral hygiene have been shown to be important for health promotion and illness prevention. This medical center advanced a registered nurse (RN)-led oral health initiative to intro- duce and standardize oral care practices.

**Problem:** To examine the impact of the oral health initiative, we conducted an evaluation of documentation trends among RNs and the effect of the initiative on patients’ oral health during hospitalization. 

**Approach:** We used a single-group pretest-posttest design and drew a sample of all inpatients who were admitted to the medical center from October 1 through December 31, 2017.

**Outcomes:** Of the 13 303 patients admitted, the empirical evidence demonstrates 99.5% compliance in documentation at admission and discharge. Among 13 237 patients, there was improvement in patients’ oral health during hospitalization (−0.03, P < .001), especially those initially assessed with moderate or severe dysfunction. 

**Conclusions:** The oral health initiative standardized assessment and care practices that have improved outcomes in patients’ oral hygiene.

### METHODS  

**Study design and sample**

For this study, we used a single-group pretest-posttest design. We obtained a sample of all inpatients who were admitted to the medical center over the 3-month period from October 1 through December 31, 2017, and who were at least 1 year of age. Only data from a patient’s first admission and discharge in that time frame were obtained for the data set; all recurring admissions were excluded. We collaborated with the hospital’s information technology department to obtain EHR data on patient oral health assessments, demographics, hospital stay, and medical conditions. This project was a quality improvement study, and, therefore, did not need to be reviewed by the institutional review board. 

**Outcome measures**

The primary outcomes were completeness of oral health documentation and the program effect on oral health. Oral health documentation was considered complete if a patient had assessments that were recorded both at admission and discharge, partially complete if only 1 assessment was recorded at either admission or discharge, or absent if an assessment was never recorded at either time point. Count data were used to measure oral health documentation. Program effect was defined as the change in oral health from admission to discharge, wherein the program is a patient’s daily intervention plan during their hospitalization. Using the oral health assessments at admission and discharge as pretest and posttest measures, respectively, oral health was measured numerically, as the difference between scores, and categorically, according to oral health outcome (i.e., if the patient’s oral health improved, worsened, or was maintained). As previously mentioned, oral hygiene categories and the associated scores were as follows: normal, 5; moderate dysfunction, 6 to 10; and severe dysfunction, 11 to 20. 

**Data analysis**

Oral health documentation was assessed using percentages. For this analysis, the subset of patients who had complete assessments (i.e., at both admission and discharge) was then examined. In comparing oral hygiene at admission and discharge, we used cross-tabulations to analyze distributions of patients across oral health categories and paired-samples t-tests to evaluate differences in means among scores.

### RESULTS

Our sample consisted of the 13303 patients who met the inclusion criteria. The majority of patients (99.7%, n = 13263) were documented for their oral hygiene at least once during their hospital visit. Twenty-six patients had partially complete documentation (i.e., only 1 assessment, either at admission or discharge). In total, 99.5% (n = 13237) of the sample was documented twice and thus had complete assessments. Among the 13 237 patients with 2 evaluations, the mean oral health score at admission was 5.07 (standard deviation = 0.61) and at discharge was 5.04 (standard deviation = 0.43). As indicated in Table 1, the overwhelming majority (94.6%) of patients received oral health scores at admission that indicated normal health (4-5), 5.2% that indicated moderate dysfunction (6-10), and 0.2% that indicated severe dysfunction (11-20). At discharge, 96.0% of patients had oral hygiene that was normal, 3.8% with moderate dysfunction, and 0.1% with severe dysfunction. 

Among the 13237 patients with complete assessments, the large majority (97.5%) maintained or improved their categorical oral health outcome through the duration of their hospital visit. Nearly all (97.4%) patients with normal health at admission were also discharged with normal health. Almost three-quarters (74.2%) of patients with moderate dysfunction progressed to normal health, and the vast majority (92.0%) of patients with severe dysfunction advanced to moderate dysfunction or normal health. 

The oral hygiene scores of this subset of patients were further analyzed using paired- samples t-tests to determine the average effect of the program for the sample and among subgroups. Table 2 shows the results of the analysis. For the sample overall, the mean difference among scores at admission and discharge (−0.03, P < .001) indicated a significant improvement in a patient’s oral health score of less than 1 point. 

The sample was also stratified by oral health categories at admission, and the estimates from the t-tests are described in Table 2. For patients with normal scores at admission, the mean difference in scores (0.05, P < .001) suggested a significant decline in oral health by a half-point. However, the average score at admission (4.97) and discharge (5.02) each approximates to an oral health score of 5, which is normal hygiene; thus, qualitatively patients maintained normal oral hygiene throughout their hospital stay. 

Among patients with moderate dysfunction and severe dysfunction, the paired t-tests indicated significant improvement in oral health scores by approximately 1 point (−1.25, P < .001) and 7 points (−6.92, P < .001), respectively. Given the mean scores at admission and discharge, on average a patient initially assessed with moderate dysfunction progressed to normal health. Similarly, patients who were documented with severe dysfunction on admission generally improved to moderate dysfunction by discharge. . . .
