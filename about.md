### About

I'm an empirical researcher aiming to use social science for social impact. My primary interest is in the application of quantitative methods, formal models, and political economy to puzzles in politics, sports, and health.

A repository of my work can be found [here](./#publications). You'll find a list of my [publications](./publications) and [presentations](./presentations), with links to the articles, analysis, or code, where possible. 

I also have experience as a peer reviewer; a list of the journals that I've refereed for can be found [here](./peer_reviewer).
