### About

As a quantitative researcher, I'm interested in addressing puzzles and problems from a social science perspective. I have experience collaborating on projects in political science, public health, medicine, and sports. 

A repository of my work can be found [here](https://smithdj.github.io/#publications). You'll find a list of my publications, presentations, and ongoing research, with links to the articles, analysis, or code, where possible.
